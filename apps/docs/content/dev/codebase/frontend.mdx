description: Learn more about the killer SearchNEU design
---

This page serves to give a rough outline of the organization of the different components that make up the frontend for SearchNEU. While we won't dive into the specific locations
of each and every file, we hope that this page helps give you a better sense of where different _types_ of components are located, as well as how these components interact with the Search database.

### An Overview

Generally speaking, finding a specific component involves the same process you would use for any Next.js application:

1. Look through the `/app` folder to find the specific page (via route) you're working on.

2. Look at either layout.tsx for website-specific changes or page.tsx for page-specific changes.

3. If you want to modify a specific component, navigate to that component from the current file you're on (VSCode lets you find implementations by right clicking on a specific component).

And that's really it! It might take a little bit to get familiar with the different endpoints and various pages, but if you take about 10-20 minutes sitting down and looking through the `/app` folder, and it'll get a bit easier to navigate.

### For Editing Existing/New Work

Once you've arrived at the specific component/page/layout to modify, you'll likely be either adding new CSS/HTML or an entirely new feature altogether. Unfortunately, there is no
"one-size-fits-all" way to explain how to go about editing. Generally, however, there are a few principles worth following, both in terms of syntax and general practice.

- **Reuse the work that previously exists**: we don't want five billion variations of the same button. When thinking about including a component, make sure to go through `/components` and see if something like it already exists instead of trying to rework it from scratch.
  On the other hand, if you're unsure of how to do write a piece of code out, look at what other people have written; Search is old, and oftentimes, whatever you want to do has in some capacity been done before.

- **Always fall back to Figma**: Our goated designers work their butts off to provide us with amazing outlines to work off of. When in doubt, either about CSS/HTML/general form, you should rely on the Figma first and foremost.

- **Use browser developer tools**: This one may seem obvious, but if you're ever struggling to pin down a specific component, or want to easily see how a specific part of Search was created, use your browsers developer tools to look at it.
  Oftentimes, you can copy/paste a specific piece of HTML from your browser's web tools into VSCode's text search feature to find the exact component being displayed.

### Tailwind CSS

As a general note, SearchNEU uses TailwindCSS for ease-of-use when formatting and decorating the website. If you ever need access to a specific color, BEFORE adding it in, be sure to review the `/app/globals.css` file to see if it already exists under another name.

**PLEASE MENTION HERE ABOUT LOCAL FONT HOSTING**

### Other Assets

Images are located in the `\public\images` folder. As of the writing of these docs, Search only has images for the changelog. Please maintain the general image naming convention for ease-of-use, and be sure to document (via a specific folder) where the images are being used.

All SVGs are stored in .tsx files in the `\components\icons` folder via exported functions. If you would like to add a new SVG, please follow-suit with the other SVGs present in this folder.
