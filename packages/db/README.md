## Schemas

### Auth Schema

The auth schema is auto-generated by Better Auth. It should not be directly edited,
instead changes should be made in the Better Auth config, and migrated with the
CLI:

```bash
# apps/searchneu
pnpm dlx @better-auth/cli@latest generate --output="../../packages/db/src/schema/auth.ts"
```
