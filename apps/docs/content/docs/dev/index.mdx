## Introduction

SearchNEU is a longstanding project; one of the oldest ones in Sandbox. As a
developer, if you're reading this, I'm sure you have some semblance of an idea
of what SearchNEU is about: helping students find classes a lot more easily than
banner does. Hopefully, this documentation will serve as your guide for navigating
Search, making a it a little bit easier to keep this awesome project in tip-top
shape!

## Getting Started

### Tech Installation

1. Install the [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) package manager. This should be installed
   directly and **not** installed through `npm`. Run `pnpm -v` to ensure it was
   successfully installed (should return version information).
2. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) following the directions on the site.
   Correct installation can be checked by running `docker -v` which should return
   version information.
3. Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en). Installation can vary by system, preferrences,
   and previous installations. The easiest way is to run `pnpm env use --global 24`
   which uses pnpm to install Node. Note that pnpm may error and require `pnpm setup`
   to be run first. Node installation can be checked with `node -v` which should return
   a version starting with `v24` (the current major Nodejs version that Search uses)
4. Install [Turborepo](https://turborepo.dev) globally with `pnpm install turbo --global`.
5. Clone the [SearchNEU github repository](https://github.com/sandboxnu/searchneu)
   with `git clone git@github.com:sandboxnu/searchneu.git`
6. Install all project dependencies! From inside the project directory, run `pnpm install`.
   This should install a bunch of packages and create some `node_module` directories.
7. Clone cache files from [SearchNEU Cache Repository](https://github.com/sandboxnu/searchneu-cache).
   These should be somewhere on your machine, but not in the main SearchNEU directory.

### Running the Project

1. Start up the database with `docker compose up -d`.
2. After the first time you spin up the database, run `turbo db:migrate` to clear
   the database. More database information can be found [here](dev/codebase/database)
3. Run `turbo db:push` to upload the drizzle schema
4. Seed the database with `turbo scrape:up -- --cachePath="<PATH_TO_CATALOG_CACHES>" --terms=all`
5. Run `turbo dev` to spin up SearchNEU and all packages
6. Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the site!
