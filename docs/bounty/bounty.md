# Bug Bounty

If you find a security vulnerability on Search NEU I'll buy you a burrito from Amelia's ðŸŒ¯ðŸŽ‰! Make sure to keep the vulnerability details secret when letting us know about it. A great way to let us know is to email us at sandboxnu@gmail.com or to use the contact form on the SearchNEU page (at the very bottom of the page). Feel free to do both! (just to make extra sure we get it :)

Security vulnerabilities include:

- Changing the code on production
- XSS vulnerabilities/running code in other people's browsers
- Accessing the environmental variables on Vercel

Vulnerabilities do not include:

- DDOSing the server (please don't spam the server with requests ðŸ˜–).
- Social engineering attempts on our team or trying to change things with unauthorized access to a team member's computer

In the end the ultimate decision over the burrito award ðŸŒ¯ is a decision that is entirely up to the team.
