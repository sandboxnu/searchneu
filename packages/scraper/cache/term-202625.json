      "description": "Highlights the key themes that are currently developing within international intelligence liaison relationships. Explores the trend towards homogenization of intelligence and other law enforcement and security initiatives. Offers students an opportunity to discuss international standardization among a widening group of partners and how these processes may establish viable frameworks and operational parameters for the intelligence liaison arrangements, together with addressing counterintelligence and other security considerations. In short, a best-practice approach is defined and explored as becoming normalized operationally, facilitating the optimization of intelligence liaison arrangements.",

      "description": "Describes how relationships are forged and fostered between policymakers and intelligence analysts. Policymakers need support from intelligence to help deal with uncertainty. Thus, policy officials come to respect and rely on analysts and managers who appreciate this aspect of the decision process. Analysts are deemed most useful when they clarify what is known by laying out the evidence and pointing to cause-and-effect patterns; carefully structure assumptions and argumentation about what is unknown and unknowable; and bring expertise to planning and action on important threats and opportunities. The heavily engaged policymaker has little use for intelligence products that emphasize prediction over explanation and opinion over evidence by assessments that trivialize the challenge of uncertainty by burying honest debate in compromise language and by ignoring high-impact contingencies.",

To provide the current and thorough intelligence analysis required today by senior policymakers, military leadership, and corporate America, all-source analysts utilize many types of intelligence: human, imaginary, signals, electronic, telemetry, communications, measurement and signals, and open-source. Professional analysts also use a variety of linking, modeling, and data-manipulation or artificial intelligence software packages.",
