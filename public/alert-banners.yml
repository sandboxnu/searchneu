# This file is used to render banner alerts on the front page of search
# To add an alert, add a new entry at the top level, preferrably with a descriptive name for the alert
# Then, add key-value pair entries to that object, text, alertLevel, isVisible, and optional link. Example:
# notificationsAlert:
#   text: "Due to a technical issue with our notification pathway through Facebook, notifications have been temporarily disabled. We're working on a new notification flow, and apologize for any inconvenience."
#   alertLevel: "error"
#   link: "https://www.w3schools.com"
# For more info, check out the AlertBanner.tsx file
