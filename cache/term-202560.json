Topics in engineering probability and statistics include descriptive statistics, expected value of random variables, and hypotheses testing. Statistical process control and sampling methods are introduced. Reliability methods for the analysis and improvement of system/design performance are discussed. Also covers fundamental concepts of time value of money and economic evaluation of alternatives, including the effects of depreciation and taxes.",

Fosters a deeper understanding of the principles of object-oriented programming and design including software components, object-oriented design patterns, and the use of graphical design notations such as UML (unified modeling language). Basic concepts in object-oriented design are illustrated with case studies in application frameworks and by writing programs in one or more object-oriented languages.",

Critiques the historical role of racism and other biases in the development and implementation of research questions and methods. Offers students an opportunity to become capable of developing a research question, investigating and critiquing how it has been researched, developing a research design, and administering its implementation.",

Emphasizes the use of rigorous mathematical tools, such as calculus, to examine the major determinants of fluctuations in employment and price level, as well as the rate of economic growth. Explores theoretical models to evaluate the operation and impact of various macroeconomic policy tools. Discusses how macroeconomic performance relates to issues of social justice.",

Students form teams and select a project requiring design and implementation of an electrical, electronic, and/or software system, including evaluation of multiple constraints, the use of appropriate engineering standards during the design to carry out the project, as well as the submission and presentation of a detailed proposal for the work. The project plan includes the consideration of public health, safety, and welfare and global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors. Students must specify a preliminary list of materials needed for their project, provide a cost analysis, and prepare and deliver written and oral presentations on the design proposal. This is the first of a two-course sequence.",

Through learning how to use numerical examples and business cases, students study corporate valuation, weighted average cost of capital (WACC), pro forma statement modeling, portfolio models, and Monte Carlo simulation methods, etc. Seeks to cultivate students’ ability to make assumptions, deal with imperfect information, and real-world data issues. Offers students an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in advanced corporate finance, asset pricing, and option pricing in a real-world context. This course is highly quantitative in nature; while it does not derive complicated mathematical formulas, familiarity with concepts such as the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), WACC, portfolio theory, and pro forma financial statements is expected.",

      "description": "Examines how empires, wars, and revolutions have influenced the development of the modern world, focusing on Europe and Europe’s connections with the non–European world. Explores how wars and revolutions led to the emergence of modern concepts of sovereignty, the state, and citizenship and how global competition between states led to the emergence of empires. Traces the promise of allegedly liberating ideologies and the political and economic revolutions they fostered, repeated wars and their aftermaths, and the challenges of recent world developments viewed from the perspective of history. Explores how human diversity and difference have shaped modern societies through history and how human difference and multiculturalism have both fostered and posed challenges to civic sustainability. Interrogates the meanings of “modernity,” democracy and totalitarianism, capitalism and socialism, and globalization.",

They are (1) globalization, from its origins in the sixteenth century to the present; (2) the potential for global pandemics to alter the course of history, from bubonic plague in the fifth century to H1N1; (3) racial inequality, from religious interpretations in the early modern period to science in the modern era; and (4) gender inequality, from the agricultural revolution forward. For each issue, studies cases and locations spread across the world, examines the links between past and present, and attempts to identify ways forward.",

Students form teams and are assigned their design project and faculty adviser. Projects can be industrially, departmentally, or externally sponsored. Students are expected to communicate with their faculty adviser, course coordinator, and sponsor using the Internet, teleconferencing, and other electronic methods. Topics include project management, ethics, cost analysis, Internet and library research methods, and engineering codes and standards. Students prepare written reports and make oral presentations. Students are expected to complete a thorough state-of-the-art report on their problem and a problem statement with specifications and requirements.",

Research is crucial to understanding social, environmental, and health problems, as well as to developing effective responses to them.

At the same time, researchers have a responsibility to protect research subjects, to appropriately engage with members of the community, and to avoid behaving in ways that undermine scientific research in the long run.

While the focus is on lower-income countries, the course examines issues in a broader global context, underscoring the interconnections between global health disparities and global health policy response. Applies case studies describing interventions to improve healthcare in resource-poor settings in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere to help illuminate the actors, diseases, populations, and principles and frameworks for the design of effective global health interventions.

It is critical that the funds are utilized well and appropriate to the objectives of the agency and program. Advancing the environment for public health through effective budgeting and promotion of program impact is important to support the continued funding for public health. The course takes students through these topics and offers them the opportunity to gain the practical experience of developing a budget for a public health program as the central activity.",

Emphasizes helping students move from a focus on levels associated with a particular workforce attribute (e.g., what is our cost per hire?) to understanding the impact of the workforce on business-level outcomes (e.g., how might an increase in the quality of our project managers affect new product cycle time?).",

Explores various sources within each tradition that serve as normative foundations, contemporary cultural and sociological dynamics that challenge those foundations, and psychological/existential considerations for understanding the general nature of human sexuality. Addresses how these traditions understand gender and gender roles, seek to shape and control interactions between men and women, regulate sexual relations outside of and within marriage, view sexuality education, regard homosexuality, and examine historical and contemporary approaches to marriage, divorce, and parenting.
