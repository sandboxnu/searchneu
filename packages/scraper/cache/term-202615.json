        "description": "Offers a special topics course that examines critical and timely issues challenging postsecondary leaders. Through individual consultations with the instructor and critical feedback from their peers, this course offers students an opportunity to explore these topics and discuss how they relate to applied research in the field of higher education administration.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        Section information text:\r\n        This advanced doctoral course provides a rigorous examination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in educational contexts. Through empirical research of current, use-inspired projects, students will engage with a variety of AI tools and methodologies and a critical analysis of AI to enhance learning and research. The curriculum encompasses a comprehensive review of AI's role in pedagogy, learning systems design, and educational research. Participants will contribute to original research on AI's efficacy in enhancing student engagement and learning outcomes. Students will contribute to a substantive literature review, data collection, and analysis for several current research projects. This course is designed for doctoral candidates seeking to advance the integration of AI in educational theory and practice.",
