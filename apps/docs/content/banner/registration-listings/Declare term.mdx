          Tells *nubanner* which term the client is interested in,

          and will grant permission to the client session (cookies `JSESSIONID`
          and `nubanner-cookie`)

          to get
          [`/searchResults/searchResults`](#studentregistrationssb-search).


          If provided cookies, then the current session is authorized.

          Otherwise, authorized cookies are returned in the response with
          `Set-Cookie`.


          *NU Banner* uses the query string `?mode=search`,

          however it doesn't seem to be necessary.


          :::note

          If you forget `term` in the body, then you'll get a response
          containing these values:


          ```json

          "regAllowed": false,

          "studentEligFailures": 

          ["No Classes Found in this Date Range"]

          ```


          There is no validation that the specified term is correct.
