## Introduction

SearchNEU is a longstanding project; the oldest one in Sandbox. As a developer, if you're reading this,
I'm sure you have some semblance of an idea of what SearchNEU is about: helping students find classes a lot more easily than banner does. Recently, a chill guy named Big Mike re-worked the SearchNEU codebase from the ground up, shifting Search from a pretty outdated codebase to a sleek,
modern (dareisay chique?) codebase. Hopefully, this documentation will serve as your guide for navigating Search,
making a it a little bit easier to keep this awesome project in tip-top shape!


### Getting Started:

1. Go to the SearchNEU github [here](https://github.com/sandboxnu/searchneu) and clone the repository. As a general practice, whenever you make a change, please make a branch off of the main repository and submit a PR for review by the rest of the team. Specifics on how to go about using Git and GitHub for this project can be found [here](/).

2. Search is composed of two apps: the documentation app (powered by [Fumadocs](https://www.fumadocs.dev/docs/ui/what-is-fumadocs)) and SearchNEU proper. Search itself is built in the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework, which itself draws on the [React](https://react.dev/) library. We rely on a [PostgreSQL](`https://www.postgresql.org/`) database to store course/class information, coupled with a [Drizzle ORM](`https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview`) (Object-Relational Mapper) for linking our TypeScript to our data.

3. Now into a little bit more of the meat: EXPLAIN PACKAGE.JSON DIFFERENT COMMANDS AND WHAT THEY DO ONCE WE FIGURE OUT DB REFACTORING
