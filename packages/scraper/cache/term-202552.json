Insofar as negotiation is the foundation of most ADR processes, the course begins there. We will analyze negotiation theory and strategy before adding mediation and collaborative law to the mix. We will look at how to represent clients in negotiation, mediation and collaborative law, how to prepare for these processes and how to develop effective strategies. The final weeks of the course will focus on understanding the essential attributes of arbitration.",

An important aspect in understanding the details covered will be comprehension of the economic policy objectives, and unintended results, of specific tax provisions such as capital gains taxation. The course is focused on the statute, cases and administrative law that define the income tax base. Tax rates are also examined and tax unit issues are covered for individual wage-earners, married couples, children living in the home, pensioners and small businesses organized as sole proprietorships.",

We begin by examining the history and theoretical origins of human rights law. We then engage the legal framework under international and regional human rights treaties and interpretations of them by international, regional and domestic courts and other actors. We examine international, regional and domestic mechanisms for monitoring compliance. Finally, we grapple with tensions among cultural and religious imperatives and traditional human rights.",

The seminar will help students: adopt tools to achieve clear and concise writing;  understand the purpose of each element of a contract and adopt the language that most clearly accomplishes that purpose; draft the operative provisions of a contract to express the agreement of the parties; and create an ¿architecture¿ for a contract to make individual provisions work together in a cohesive document.  The seminar will address concepts applicable to a wide range of transactional legal documents, with emphasis on drafting in the context of corporate transactions, including employment issues, shareholders¿ rights, and mergers and acquisitions.",

Students will be graded on their responses to mid-term and final essay questions and the demonstration of their comprehension of the subject matter in the classroom.

Consumer products that rely on computer code can now kill us, and one appropriately targeted zero day exploit could potentially devastate our economy. We will discuss why data breaches continue to run rampant, what duties of data care and code safety are owed to consumers, and how various government agencies are tackling the consumer protection and national security issues implicated by vulnerable computer code.

By following the growth of a hypothetical startup company as it confronts new data privacy and security issues, offers students an opportunity to evaluate the principles grounding data privacy regulations around the world; examine emerging data privacy legal regimes of various countries; and consider privacy laws, why they matter, and what compliance concerns they raise. Encompasses privacy and security issues involved in regulatory compliance, data breach response, government and internal investigations, litigation, and mergers and acquisitions. Also considers special circumstances of cross-border litigation and transactions, the special problems raised by supply chains and corporate social responsibility, and emerging concerns arising from big data and increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence.",
