Nobody likes paperwork. But with multiple teams working in the same codebase and
real users depending on SearchNEU, a little process goes a long way toward preventing
headaches.

This section contains two lightweight frameworks:

- **Platform Change Proposals (PCPs)** - How we communicate breaking changes
  between teams before they happen
- **Incident Management** - How we coordinate when things break in production

The **Proposals** and **Incidents** sections below serve as living archives. When
you file a PCP or write a post-mortem, it ends up here - both for review and so
future contributors can learn from past decisions and mistakes.

The goal isn't bureaucracy for its own sake. It's making sure that when you push
a change you're not blindsiding another team, and when something breaks at 2am
there's a playbook that doesn't live solely in someone's head.
